# üß† Possible Link Between MTHFR-Related Folate Metabolism, Homocysteine, and Acetylcholine Function in OCD and Cardiovascular Disease

This repository presents a hypothesis exploring a potential biochemical connection between MTHFR-related folate metabolism, homocysteine regulation, and acetylcholine function ‚Äî proposing a shared mechanism that could underlie both Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

## üî¨ Abstract

Reduced activity of the MTHFR enzyme may lower 5-MTHF levels, impairing methylation and altering choline metabolism. This, in turn, could affect acetylcholine synthesis in the brain while elevating homocysteine ‚Äî a known cardiovascular risk factor. The overlap suggests a biochemical pathway linking neuropsychiatric and vascular conditions within families.
