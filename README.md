# 🧠 Possible Link Between MTHFR-Related Folate Metabolism, Homocysteine, and Acetylcholine Function in OCD and Cardiovascular Disease

This repository presents a hypothesis exploring a potential biochemical connection between MTHFR-related folate metabolism, homocysteine regulation, and acetylcholine function — proposing a shared mechanism that could underlie both Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

## 🔬 Abstract

Reduced activity of the MTHFR enzyme may lower 5-MTHF levels, impairing methylation and altering choline metabolism. This, in turn, could affect acetylcholine synthesis in the brain while elevating homocysteine — a known cardiovascular risk factor. The overlap suggests a biochemical pathway linking neuropsychiatric and vascular conditions within families.

## ⚙️ Hypothesis Flow

**MTHFR or related folate-pathway variants → reduced 5-MTHF → elevated homocysteine and altered choline metabolism → possible acetylcholine dysregulation → neuropsychiatric and vascular effects (OCD, CVD)**
